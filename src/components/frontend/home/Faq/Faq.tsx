          The timeline for website development can vary depending on the
          complexity and requirements of the project. On average, a standard
          website can take between 4 to 8 weeks from initial consultation to
          launch. More complex projects, such as e-commerce sites or custom
          applications, may take longer. We will provide a detailed timeline
          after discussing your specific needs.

          Our process begins with an initial consultation to understand your

          phase, followed by design and development. Throughout the project, we
          maintain open communication to ensure your vision is realized. After
          development, we conduct thorough testing before launching the site.
          Post-launch, we offer support and maintenance services.
